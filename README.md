This is the code for an API I just made.

# How to use the API
Send GET requests to `https://youtubeapi.up.railway.app`. See below for more details.

**For video data:**
Send a GET request like this: `https://youtubeapi.up.railway.app/getVideo?videoId=[VIDEO ID HERE]&quality=[QUALITY HERE]`
For example: `https://youtubeapi.up.railway.app/getVideo?videoId=95m45ozwwZw&quality=1080p`. You can try put that into your browser to test it.

**For audio data:**
Send a GET request like this: `https://youtubeapi.up.railway.app/getAudio?videoId=[VIDEO ID HERE]`
For example: `https://youtubeapi.up.railway.app/getAudio?videoId=95m45ozwwZw`. You can try put that into your browser to test it.

That's all you can do for now. I'll probably update this in the future.
