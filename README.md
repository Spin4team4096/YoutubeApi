This is the code for an API. I used ChatGPT because I don't usually do this lol. There's no reason for this to rlly exist anymore though, because I asked a fellow human to make one and they made smth pretty awesome! I don't have their repo link rn but I'll add it here eventually

# How to use the API
Send GET requests to `https://youtubeapi.up.railway.app`. See below for more details.
**NOTE: I DON'T HAVE MONEY ANYMORE.** The API is down and I don't need any donations. As I said above, use the other repo, this one is kinda bad

**For video data:**
Send a GET request like this: `https://youtubeapi.up.railway.app/getVideo?videoId=[VIDEO ID HERE]&quality=[QUALITY HERE]`
For example: `https://youtubeapi.up.railway.app/getVideo?videoId=95m45ozwwZw&quality=1080p`. You can try put that into your browser to test it.

**For audio data:**
Send a GET request like this: `https://youtubeapi.up.railway.app/getAudio?videoId=[VIDEO ID HERE]`
For example: `https://youtubeapi.up.railway.app/getAudio?videoId=95m45ozwwZw`. You can try put that into your browser to test it.

That's all you can do for now. I'll probably update this in the future.
